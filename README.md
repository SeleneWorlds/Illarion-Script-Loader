## About this Repository

This is a Selene bundle implementing a bridge between Selene and server scripts of the roleplaying game Illarion.
It is designed to implement the missing game-specific functionality that would otherwise be implemented by the game's
server executable.

The original sources used to derive this implementation can be found under https://github.com/Illarion-eV.
